# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module covers implementing multimodal AI systems that combine vision, language
understanding, and action generation for intelligent humanoid robot behavior.

## Coming Soon

The following chapters are being developed:

### Chapter 1: Speech Recognition Integration (Whisper)
- OpenAI Whisper deployment
- Real-time speech processing
- Noise robustness for robot environments

### Chapter 2: Large Language Model Reasoning
- LLM integration patterns
- Task planning from natural language
- Context and memory management

### Chapter 3: Vision-Language Grounding
- Visual question answering for robots
- Object and scene understanding
- Spatial reasoning from language

### Chapter 4: Action Generation from Natural Language
- Language-to-motion mapping
- Safety-constrained action execution
- Feedback and clarification loops

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of transformer architectures
- GPU with sufficient VRAM for LLM inference
- API access or local deployment capability

## Physical-First Notes

All examples in this module include:
- Latency considerations for real-time interaction
- Safety verification before action execution
- Human-in-the-loop patterns for uncertain commands
