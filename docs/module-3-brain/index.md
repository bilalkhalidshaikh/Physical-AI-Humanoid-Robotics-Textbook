# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (Isaac Sim)

This module covers training intelligent robot behaviors using NVIDIA Isaac Sim,
including reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer techniques.

## Coming Soon

The following chapters are being developed:

### Chapter 1: Domain Randomization for Sim-to-Real
- Visual randomization techniques
- Physics parameter randomization
- Bridging the reality gap

### Chapter 2: Reinforcement Learning Pipelines
- Isaac Gym integration
- PPO and SAC algorithms
- Reward function design

### Chapter 3: Motion Policy Training
- Locomotion policies for humanoids
- Manipulation skill learning
- Multi-task policy architectures

### Chapter 4: Perception Model Training
- Synthetic data generation
- Object detection and segmentation
- Depth estimation networks

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- NVIDIA GPU with RTX capabilities
- Isaac Sim 2023.1 or newer installed
- Basic deep learning knowledge (PyTorch)

## Physical-First Notes

All examples in this module include:
- Sim-to-real transfer validation strategies
- Hardware deployment considerations
- Safety constraints during policy execution
