# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo)

This module covers creating accurate digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo for
simulation, testing, and validation.

## Coming Soon

The following chapters are being developed:

### Chapter 1: URDF/SDF Robot Modeling
- Understanding robot description formats
- Joint types and limits
- Visual and collision geometry

### Chapter 2: Physics Engine Configuration
- Physics solver selection
- Contact and friction parameters
- Simulation stability tuning

### Chapter 3: Sensor Plugins and Noise Models
- Camera and depth sensor simulation
- IMU and force/torque sensors
- Adding realistic noise profiles

### Chapter 4: World and Environment Design
- Creating simulation environments
- Dynamic objects and actors
- Lighting and visual fidelity

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Gazebo Fortress or newer installed
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems

## Physical-First Notes

All examples in this module include:
- Reality gap considerations and limitations
- Sim-to-real transfer preparation
- Validation against physical robot data
